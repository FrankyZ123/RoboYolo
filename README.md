# RoboYolo

## Summary
Hello and welcome! This is the code repository for my Capstone Project for my Computer Science Degree at Minerva. The goal of the project is simple: expand the Mindstorm development ecosystem by demonstrating and implementating novel machine learning concepts such that a non-technical user can build and "program" task specific LEGO robots.

## Update Log
December 10th, 2020: This project currently implements the You Only Look Once v3 model in an iOS app to translate human classification to simple EV3 motor movement given a bluetooth connection. Here is an example of the current implementation: https://youtu.be/oPFeJHn_I8s
